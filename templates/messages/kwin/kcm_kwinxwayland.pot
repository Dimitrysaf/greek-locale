"Some legacy X11 apps require the ability to read keystrokes typed in other "
"apps for certain features, such as handling global keyboard shortcuts. This "
"is allowed by default. However other features may require the ability to "
"read all keys, and this is disabled by default for security reasons. If you "
"need to use such apps, you can choose your preferred balance of security and "
"functionality here."
